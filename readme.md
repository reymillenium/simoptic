## Tecnical Requirements:

In order to properly work the system and to be truly visualized all the contents and images contained on the installer, is essential to be set a display's definition of 1024 x 768 pixels. It isn't necessary to do it manually, because just at the beginning, when the application was executed, the own system always check which is the initial display's definition, and later that will set to 1024 X 768 pixels. Before closing the application, the own system will set again the old display's definition.

Besides, in order to be properly visualized the software interface, you must have installed on the PC the theme "Windows's Clasic", or a similar one. With the Install CD will be provided a Theme that allows the system to be properly visualized.


## Another Requirements:

- CD Reader.
- 128Mb of RAM memory.
- Monitor VGA o SVGA that allow a 1024 x 768 pixeles definition. 
- Space in HDD 124.0 Mb.
- Operative System Windows 9x, ME, NT, XP or Vista.
